# CURSEPAINT

A small, terminal-based program meant to create ascii-based art. Designed to be used with ncurses aplications and games, and to be a robust application with all necessary tools and features to create any art. 

# Note for those that stumble upon this program

This is a salvaged project I'm returning to, it may be a while before it's fully user friendly. For now, if one wishes to compile, use the "$make" command in the terminal after cloning, and, if it does not work, run "$make clean" and then "$make". 

## Temporary commands: 
 	* wasd: Move cursor
	* jkui: Change brush
	* {space}: Holster brush, tap again to unholster
	* e: swap to eraser, tap again to return to the brush  
	* {dot} {comma} ( . , ): Change brush gap

	* t: text input
 	
	* r: reset brush pos
		
	* Y: clear screen
	* q: quit safely
	* Q: kill program
	* +: save
	* o: open

	

# Upcoming Features

	* Color support: With an easily implemented formatting for use with NCurses
	* Non-Ascii support: With a toggle, as it would be harder to implement with NCurses
